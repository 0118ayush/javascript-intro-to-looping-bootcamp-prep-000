## About

Loops are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. You've seen them in Ruby. For instance, think back to the `times` loop:

```ruby
3.times do
  puts "Hello world!"
end

# The above prints:
# Hello world!
# Hello world!
# Hello world!
```

Instead of a `times` loop, JavaScript offers a `for` loop. Ruby also knows how to execute a block of code `while` a condition is true. JavaScript has an almost identical equivalent: the `while` loop. JavaScript also has a `do-while` loop, which we'll cover at the end of this reading.

## The For Loop

The `for` loop is made up of four statements and has the following structure:

#### Syntax

```javascript
for ( [initialization]; [condition]; [iteration] ) {
  [loopBody]
}
```

- initialization
  An expression (including assignment expressions) or variable declaration. Typically used to initialize a counter variable. This expression may optionally declare new variables with the var keyword

- condition
  An expression evaluated before each loop iteration. If this expression evaluates to true, statement is executed

- iteration
  A statement executed at the end of each iteration. Typically, this will involve incrementing or decrementing a counter and thus bringing the loop ever closer to its end

- loopBody
  code which runs on every iteration as long as condition evaluates to true

  > Use `for` loop when you know how many times you want the loop to run

#### Example

The code below will print the string "Hello World!" 99 times
  
```javascript
// i is set to equal to 0
// as long as i is less than 100 execute the code in the loopBody
// - which is print "Hello World"; increment i each time code in loopBody is executed

for (var i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
  console.log( "Hello World the " + i + " time" );
}

// The above prints:
// Hello World the 1 time
// Hello World the 2 time
// Hello World the 3 time
```

You'll encounter `for()` loops again when you learn about iteration through object literals.

## The While Loop

The `while` loop similar to an if statement, except that its body will keep executing until the condition evaluates to false. Has the following structure:
  
#### Syntax

```javascript
while ([condition]) {
  [loopBody]
}
```

- condition
  An expression evaluated before each pass through the loop (each pass is either an increment or a decrement). If this condition evaluates to true, statement is executed

  > Use `while` loop when you don't know how many times your loop needs to run - that is your condition is dependent on some a dynamic function/return value

#### Example

```javascript
// i is set to Zero
var i = 0;

// while i is less than seven
while ( i < 7) {
  ++i;
  console.log( "Hello World! for the " + i + " time");
}

// The above prints:
// Hello World! for the 1 time
// Hello World! for the 2 time
// Hello World! for the 3 time
// Hello World! for the 4 time
// Hello World! for the 5 time
// Hello World! for the 6 time
// Hello World! for the 7 time
```

## The Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop is almost exactly the same as the while loop, except for the fact that the loopâ€™s body is executed at least once before the condition is tested. Has the following structure:

#### Syntax

```javascript
do {
  [loopBody];
} while ([condition]);
```
  
You will rarely see `do-while` used since very few situations require a loop that blindly executes at least once. That being said, take a look at the example below:

#### Example

```javascript
var i = 0;

do {
   i += 1;
   console.log(i);
} while (i < 5);

// The above prints:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```
